MazeProblem Formalization:
MazeProblems represent 2D pathfinding problems, as programmatically
formalized via:

=== Mazes ===
Represented as a list of strings in which:
  X = impassable wall
  * = the initial state
  . = open cells
  G = goal states
All valid mazes have:
  - At most 1 initial state
  - At least 1 goal state
  - A border of walls (plus possibly other walls)
  - A solution
(We'll ignore invalid maze states as possible inputs, for simplicity)

Maze elements are indexed starting at (0, 0) [top left of maze]. E.g.,
["XXXXX", "X..GX", "X...X", "X*..X", "XXXXX"] is interpretable as:
  01234
0 XXXXX
1 X..GX
2 X...X
3 X*..X
4 XXXXX

=== States ===
Representing the position of the agent, as tuples in which:
(x, y) = (col, row)
(0, 0) is located at the top left corner; Right is +x, and Down is +y

=== Actions ===
Representing the allowable Up, Down, Left, and Right movement capabilities
of the agent in the 2D Maze; we'll simply use string representations:
"U", "D", "L", "R"

=== Transitions ===
Given some state s, the transitions will be represented as a list of tuples
of the format:
[(action1, result(action1, s)), ...]
For example, if an agent is at state (1, 1), and can only move right and down,
then the transitions for that s = (1, 1) would be:
[("R", (2, 1)), ("D", (1, 2))]
